  <h2 class="term-header">Who are we</h2>
  <h3 class="term-text term-tild">~$ </h3><h3 class="term-text">Officially formed in 2020, we're a society of students from varying disciplines who all share (at least) one thing in common: a love for solving problems. Collectively our goal is to not just become the most experienced Cyber Security competitors in Australia, but around the world as well. Hailing from the University fo Queensland, we plan to achieve this through weekly trainings, consistent practice, and competitive event participation.</h3>

  <h2 class="term-header">What we do</h2>
  <h3 class="term-text term-tild">~$ </h3><h3 class="term-text">As of right now we've competed in 5 events around Australia, earning various respectable accolades. Our weekly meetings consist of a talk given either by an industry professional or one of our own experts, followed by some related practical challenges. Every two weeks we release a HTB-like machine for all members to practice on, which is also supplemented by a writeup when the next one is released.</h3>

  <h2 class="term-header">Why we do it</h2>
  <h3 class="term-text term-tild">~$ </h3><h3 class="term-text">Simply put, we do what we do for two reasons: because it's important, and because we like it. Cyber Security is one of the most emergent threats facing our lives, and knowledge about the field is not nearly as widespread as it should be - our society seeks to help improve understanding about its various impacts, and what we can do to mitigate them. Plus, it's always a bit of fun too!</h3>
